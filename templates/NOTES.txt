Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}

You will see that currently the stack only contains NATS and a Gateway server.
To continue, you need to run curl into the gateway server to get our initial seed address.

curl http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:<YOUR_GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT>/node-info/

This will resulted in a JSON response, which will contain the seed address in the property "address". 
Or you can check the log produced by the gateway to get the address.
The address will look something like this: 0@/ip4/192.168.65.3/udp/3001/ip4/192.168.65.3/tcp/3001

This seed address are necessary to initialize the Atm0s stack/cluster.

Now you can update the default values.yaml, enable your favorite server to get up an running.
